what assembly instruction i would need to use on arm cortex-a7 to turn the system off using the ARM Power State Coordination Interface?

To turn off the system using the **ARM Power State Coordination Interface (PSCI)** on an **ARM Cortex-A7** processor, you typically use the **SMC (Secure Monitor Call)** instruction to invoke the appropriate PSCI function.

### Overview

The **PSCI** interface is a standardized way to control power states (like **shutdown**, **suspend**, **CPU on/off**, etc.) in ARM systems. The **Cortex-A7** uses **SMC** (or optionally **HVC**, but SMC is more common) to make calls from the non-secure world into the secure monitor, which implements the PSCI interface.

## üîß Instruction to Turn Off the System (Shutdown)

### ‚úîÔ∏è Use the `SMC` instruction to call `PSCI_SYSTEM_OFF`

### 1. PSCI Function ID for System Off

The function ID for `PSCI_SYSTEM_OFF` depends on the PSCI version, but for **PSCI v0.2 and above** (which is common), the ID is:

```assembly
#define PSCI_SYSTEM_OFF     0x84000008
```

This is a **32-bit SMC call** (see the `0x8` prefix).

### 2. Calling `PSCI_SYSTEM_OFF` in Assembly

Here‚Äôs an **example ARMv7-A** assembly snippet to issue the `PSCI_SYSTEM_OFF` call:

```assembly
mov r0, #0x84000008    ; PSCI_SYSTEM_OFF function ID
smc #0                 ; Make the SMC call
```

After this call, the system is expected to power off, assuming the platform firmware (e.g., ARM Trusted Firmware / OP-TEE / Secure Monitor) supports PSCI and handles `PSCI_SYSTEM_OFF` correctly.

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

1. Ensure your platform supports PSCI (usually in secure firmware like ARM Trusted Firmware).
2. The call is made from the **non-secure world**, typically in EL1 or SVC mode (supervisor).
3. The secure world must handle the PSCI call and manage the system shutdown.

## üß™ Example in Context (Full Minimal Snippet)

```assembly
.global _start
.section .text

_start:
    ldr r0, =0x84000008  ; Load PSCI_SYSTEM_OFF function ID into r0
    smc #0               ; Secure Monitor Call to invoke PSCI
    b .                  ; Infinite loop in case shutdown fails
```

## üìù Notes

- If the system doesn't shut down, check that:
  - Your platform uses ARM Trusted Firmware with PSCI support.
  - The secure monitor is configured to allow non-secure SMC calls.
  - Your firmware/platform has implemented and enabled `PSCI_SYSTEM_OFF`.
